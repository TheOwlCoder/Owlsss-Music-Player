    I got no time<br>
    I got no time to live<br>
    I got no time to live, and I can't say goodbye<br>
    And I'm regretting having memories<br>
    Of my friends, who they used to be<br>
    Beside me before they left me to die<br>
    And I know this is<br>
    I know this is the truth<br>
    'Cause I've been staring at my death so many times<br>
    These scary monsters roaming in the halls<br>
    I wish I could just lock the doors<br>
    And stay in bed until the clock will chime<br>
    So my flashlight's on<br>
    And stay up 'til dawn<br>
    I got this headache, and my life's on the line<br>
    I felt like I won<br>
    But I wasn't done<br>
    The nightmare repeats itself every time<br>
    Gotta keep my calm<br>
    And carry on<br>
    Stay awake until the sun will shine<br>
    But I'm not so strong<br>
    And they're not gone<br>
    They're still out there to take what's left of mine<br>
    I have this urge<br>
    I have this urge to kill<br>
    I have this urge to kill to show that I'm alive<br>
    I'm getting sick from these apologies<br>
    From people with priorities<br>
    That they're life matters so much more than mine<br>
    But I'm stuttering<br>
    I'm stuttering again<br>
    No one will listen, and no one will understand<br>
    Because I'm crying as much as I speak<br>
    'Cause no one likes me when I shriek<br>
    Want to go back to when it all began<br>
    So my flashlight's on<br>
    And stay up 'til dawn<br>
    I got this headache, and my life's on the line<br>
    I felt like I won<br>
    But I wasn't done<br>
    The nightmare repeats itself every time<br>
    Gotta keep my calm<br>
    And carry on<br>
    Stay awake until the sun will shine<br>
    But I'm not so strong<br>
    And they're not gone<br>
    They're still out there to take what's left of mine<br>
    What's left of mine<br>
    I got no time<br>
    I got no time to live<br>
    I got no time to live, and I can't say goodbye<br>
    No time<br>
    I got no time to live<br>
    I got no time to live, and I can't say goodbye<br>
    I got no time<br>
    I got no time<br>
    I got no time<br>
    Five nights at Freddy's<br>
    Is this where you wanna be?<br>
