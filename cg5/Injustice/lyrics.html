    Sharp as a blade, I can strike into action<br>
    Call the syndicate, we shall seek satisfaction<br>
    I've been living and fighting in this war of life<br>
    But it doesn't matter how hard I try<br>
    While heroes die, new tyrants rise<br>
    As the totem glows<br>
    Voices welcome me home<br>
    Every word you say on a throne of lies<br>
    That fail to come to my surprise<br>
    Nations fall<br>
    My fireworks fly<br>
    Blood is the only way<br>
    (Paint the blue skies red)<br>
    Injustice I'll repay<br>
    Leave them out for dead<br>
    I keep my friends close, and enemies closer<br>
    History repeats itself over and over<br>
    I've forgotten how all the flowers smell<br>
    The beauty they hold, I cannot tell<br>
    It all begins<br>
    When I ring the bell<br>
    Blood is the only way<br>
    (Paint the blue skies red)<br>
    Injustice I'll repay<br>
    Leave them out for dead<br>
    La-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la, la-la<br>
    Ooh-ooh (la)<br>
    Still my withering heart<br>
    Yearns for peace and mercy<br>
    But I'm ready for revolution now<br>
    So let the blood stain the ground<br>
    Burn it down<br>
    And take the crown<br>
    Blood is the only way<br>
    (Paint the blue skies red)<br>
    Injustice I'll repay<br>
    Leave them out for dead
