    I'm not the one to trust<br>
    When I've lost everything that I've touched<br>
    I built a land in the sky<br>
    But I can't remember why<br>
    Oh, don't tell them what you've done, tell them what you've done<br>
    The war's already won, why do we go on?<br>
    Don't tell them what you've done, tell them what you've done<br>
    Tell them what you've done, tell them what you've done<br>
    (Tell them what you've done)<br>
    Scared of the water<br>
    Scared of the rain (the rain)<br>
    Scared of the memories that<br>
    Make me insane (someone help me)<br>
    I'm scared of the smile, I<br>
    See on the page (oh-oh)<br>
    I'll cover this vibrant eyes<br>
    And forget the pain<br>
    Little voice ruining my consciousness<br>
    Nothing left to reminisce<br>
    I would rather run away<br>
    (Lessons learned from the page)<br>
    (Lore is written to the day)<br>
    (All this pain will make me suffocate)<br>
    All my thoughts ever strange<br>
    Free me from the mental cage<br>
    How could I forget my name?<br>
    Scared of the water (so scared)<br>
    Scared of the rain (someone help me)<br>
    Scared of the memories that (oh-oh)<br>
    Make me insane (someone help me)<br>
    I'm scared of the smile, I (hey, hey)<br>
    See on the page (oh, I see it on the page)<br>
    I'll cover these vibrant eyes<br>
    And forget the pain (oh-oh-oh)<br>
    Don't tell them what you've done<br>
    Tell them what you've done (tell them what you've done)<br>
    The war's already won, why do we go on? (Why do we go on?)<br>
    Don't tell them what you've done, tell them what you've done<br>
    Tell them what you've done, tell them what you've done<br>
    (Tell them what you've done)<br>
