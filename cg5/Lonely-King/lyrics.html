    Yeah, hey! (Hmm, glory, glory)
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play
    But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way!
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play
    No matter the lives of the people before me
    All that I seek is the path to glory, glory (hmm, glory, glory)
    Chips in my pocket and blood stains on my hands
    I'm building my legacy right here in the sand!
    I'll stay until the end and watch it go down in flames
    Yeah, maybe the path is gory
    Whatever it takes to get my glory, glory (hmm, glory, glory)
    I was told I had to walk away
    Leave my enemies to rot in their own grave
    But scars don't heal, I've given blood a taste
    I'll fake the smile they've seen before
    They'll see I am so much more
    Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
    Ooh, yeah! So!
    The rule of the land, it's so crucial to obey
    Believe in yourself, or you won't be appreciated!
    Don't you overthink it, just do what I say!
    Lay the politics out before me
    Whatever it takes to get my glory (hmm, glory, glory)
    You! You need all the power and the fame!
    'Cause that's the game
    You've been kicked into the sand
    I've built something better than
    What you could ever dream of on your own
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play
    But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way!
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play
    No matter the lives of the people before me
    All that I seek is the path to glory!
    My glory, ah! (Hmm, glory, glory)</p>
