    Oh my gosh, I love you<br>
    I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    When I wake up, I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    You know our love was<br>
    Ten times sweeter than candy<br>
    Ten times sweeter than cake<br>
    Thinkin', thinkin' about you<br>
    Ding dong, trick or treat<br>
    I was knockin' at your door every week<br>
    And I saw you in my fortune cookie<br>
    What a great gift like a basket of goodies<br>
    But you were cold as an ICEE<br>
    And I got a little bit of a brain freeze<br>
    I could speak your language (language!)<br>
    If you just let me<br>
    Let me in<br>
    I don't need a dating app<br>
    'Cause I've got a Candy Crush on you<br>
    But you broke me like a Kit-Kat<br>
    Left my heart not found, rotting in the trash<br>
    Now I'm scrolling and paroling through your Instagram feed<br>
    No, I'm not trolling but you're all I wanna see<br>
    Insanity approaching, man, I'm drinkin' jealousy<br>
    Like a Coca-Coly, oh-wee<br>
    I'm gonna keep the doctor away<br>
    'Cause you're my apple every day<br>
    Every day I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    When I wake up, I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    You know our love was<br>
    Ten times sweeter than candy<br>
    Ten times sweeter than cake<br>
    Thinkin', thinkin' about you (alright, alright)<br>
    She an angel, like a food cake<br>
    Got a halo and I'm lookin' like a double take<br>
    Stream with me, I'ma be your e-boy<br>
    We gon' mine diamonds, ayy, I know I'm a bad boy<br>
    I've been lookin' in a jar full of jelly beans<br>
    Fly me to the Moon Pie up in Tennessee<br>
    Baby, I'll find you, yeah, we were meant to be<br>
    With a Ring Pop, I'll get down on one knee<br>
    Marry me<br>
    Willy Wonka, Willy, Willy Wonka<br>
    I'ma be your chocolatier (pipa)<br>
    Oompa loompa, doopity-doo<br>
    You're the one I need<br>
    So have no fear (aye-aye-aye-yah)<br>
    Can I call you mine?<br>
    Be my valentine<br>
    The one of my dreams<br>
    Let me kiss you like Hershey's (oh-oh-oh)<br>
    I'm gonna keep the doctor away (away)<br>
    'Cause you're my apple every day<br>
    And every day I'm thinking (hey)<br>
    Every day I'm thinkin'<br>
    Every day I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you (language!)<br>
    Thinkin', thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    When I wake up, I'm thinkin'<br>
    Thinkin' about you, muffin<br>
    You know our love was<br>
    Ten times sweeter than candy<br>
    Ten times sweeter than cake<br>
    Thinkin', thinkin' about you<br>
    You bet I'm thinking about you<br>
    Hey<br>
    Da-da-di-da-yuh<br>
    Da, da, da, da-da-da<br>
    Hey!<br>
    Da-da-di-da-yuh<br>
    Da, da, da-da-da<br>
    Your love was ten times sweeter than candy<br>
    Ten times sweeter than cake<br>
    Thinkin', thinkin' about you
