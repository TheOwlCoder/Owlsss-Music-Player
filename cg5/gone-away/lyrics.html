    I see the face of peace on the horizon<br>
    Rising in the east<br>
    But it only took one moment<br>
    Just one moment<br>
    Now we got battle scars<br>
    And freedom feels so far away<br>
    Tyranny was meant to be<br>
    All that remains is an unfinished symphony<br>
    He was so in love with chaos, I could never see<br>
    Good things don't happen to heroes just like you and me<br>
    It only took one moment (one)<br>
    Just one moment (one)<br>
    These adventures are a gift<br>
    And we will never drift away<br>
    The thing I built this nation for<br>
    Doesn't exist anymore<br>
    Gone away<br>
    It only took one moment<br>
    Just one moment<br>
    Our life and liberty<br>
    And pursuit of victory gone away<br>
    The thing I built this nation for<br>
    Doesn't exist anymore<br>
    Gone away
