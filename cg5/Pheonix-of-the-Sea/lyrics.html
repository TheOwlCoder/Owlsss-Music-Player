    Yeah, hey! (Hmm, glory, glory)<br>
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play<br>
    But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way!<br>
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play<br>
    No matter the lives of the people before me<br>
    All that I seek is the path to glory, glory (hmm, glory, glory)<br>
    Chips in my pocket and blood stains on my hands<br>
    I'm building my legacy right here in the sand!<br>
    I'll stay until the end and watch it go down in flames<br>
    Yeah, maybe the path is gory<br>
    Whatever it takes to get my glory, glory (hmm, glory, glory)<br>
    I was told I had to walk away<br>
    Leave my enemies to rot in their own grave<br>
    But scars don't heal, I've given blood a taste<br>
    I'll fake the smile they've seen before<br>
    They'll see I am so much more<br>
    Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
    Ooh, yeah! So!<br>
    The rule of the land, it's so crucial to obey<br>
    Believe in yourself, or you won't be appreciated!<br>
    Don't you overthink it, just do what I say!<br>
    Lay the politics out before me<br>
    Whatever it takes to get my glory (hmm, glory, glory)<br>
    You! You need all the power and the fame!<br>
    'Cause that's the game<br>
    You've been kicked into the sand<br>
    I've built something better than<br>
    What you could ever dream of on your own<br>
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play<br>
    But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way!<br>
    The role of the king is a lonely one to play<br>
    No matter the lives of the people before me<br>
    All that I seek is the path to glory!<br>
    My glory, ah! (Hmm, glory, glory)</p>
