    I cannot be moved<br>
    I do what I do anyway<br>
    In the ocean blue<br>
    We'll go with the groove everyday<br>
    Oh, my beloved, come, follow me<br>
    Flow with the motion, down the stream<br>
    I'll be your guardian, I'll be your friend<br>
    I'll be your friend!<br>
    Phoenix of the sea, swimmin' in the deep, subaquatically (ya, ya, ya!)<br>
    Healing is a breeze, understandably, can you feel the beat? (Ya, ya, ya!)<br>
    I just wanna be free! Free to be, free to be me! (Yeah)<br>
    I just wanna be free! Free to be, free to be me!<br>
    Take me to the shore, so much to explore, it's all so great<br>
    In that bucket o' yours, keep me safe and warm out in the rain<br>
    Gonna be goin' back home, don't wanna be all alone<br>
    Underwater galaxy, and it's all for me, yeah, yeah!<br>
    Oh, my beloved, come, follow me<br>
    Go with the motion, down the stream<br>
    I'll be your guardian, I'll be your friend<br>
    I'll be your friend!<br>
    Phoenix of the sea, swimmin' in the deep, subaquatically (ya, ya, ya!)<br>
    Healin' is a breeze, understandably, can you feel the beat? (Ya, ya, ya!)<br>
    I just wanna be free! Free to be, free to be me! (Ah! Yeah)<br>
    I just wanna be free! (Ah!) Free to be, free to be me!<br>
    Free to be, free to be, free<br>
    Free to be, free to be me (oh God! Yeah!)<br>
    Free to be, free to be, free<br>
    Free to be, free to be me
